Spiro.Angular
=============

Spiro.Angular is a library for accessing a Restful Objects API using the Angular.js framework.  The representations returned by the API may be accessed either as the classes defined in Spiro.Models (on which Spiro.Angular depends) or transformed into simpler custom-defined classes -  which would typically be simpler (though less powerful) than the Spiro.Models.
