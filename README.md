Spiro.Angular
=============

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8d8pvxn0d6oxnpv0)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/scascarini/spiro-angular)

Spiro.Angular is a library for accessing a [Restful Objects](http://restfulobjects.org) API using the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework.  

The library provides (currently: aims to provide) a <tt>$spiroResource</tt> service that acts as a more functional replacement for AngularJS' own [$resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource).  This transforms the Restul Objects representations into a simpler format for easier consumption (eg by [AngularStrap](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/) or [Angular-UI](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)).

See the [project website](http://spirolibraries.github.io/Spiro.Angular/) for more detail.
