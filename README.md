Spiro.Angular
=============

Spiro.Angular is a library for accessing a [Restful Objects](http://restfulobjects.org) API using the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework.  

The library provides (currently: aims to provide) a <tt>$spiroResource</tt> service that acts as a more functional replacement for AngularJS' own [$resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource).  This transforms the Restul Objects representations into a simpler format for easier consumption (eg by [AngularStrap](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/) or [Angular-UI](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)).

Under the covers Spiro.Angular depends upon the classes defined in [Spiro.Models](https://github.com/SpiroLibraries/Spiro.Models). 

Spiro.Angular is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and compiled to JavaScript.
